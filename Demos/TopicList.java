     conditional expressions and control structures with boolean
          - if statement - is a construct that enables a program to specifiy alternative paths 
                           of execution
          - if=else statement - decides the execution path based on whether the condition is true 
                                or false 
          - nesteded if and multi-way if-else statement - can be inside another if statement 
                                                          to form a nested if statement 
     
     loops 
      The difference between a while loop and a do-while loop is the order in which 
      the loop-continuation-condition is evaluated and the loop body executed.
          - loop - can be used to tell a program to execute statements repeatly 
          - for-loop - has a concise synatx for writing loops
          - while-loop - executes statements repeatedly while the condition is true 
          - do-while-loop - executes the loop body first, then checks the loop-continuation
                            condition to determine whether to continue or terminate the loop
                            
     built-in String functions
            str.length() 
            str.toLowerCase() - makes all letters lowercase
            str.toUpperCase() - makes all letters uppercase
            str.equals("some other string") - checks if two Strings are exactly the same
            str.equalsIgnoreCase("no") - checks if two Strings are equal regardless of case
            str.charAt(int index) - get a specific character at index
            str.substring(int startIndex, int ending Index) - gives a subset string based on given range
