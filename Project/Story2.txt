  The girl stands up and looks at you with 
questioning eyes. She seems timid and frightened as well.
She takes a half step towards you and pauses. It seems
she's waiting for something. You say 
nothing unsure what you do or say. She suddenely 
looks completely terror stricken and dashes out 
the door. You try to follow but the door is locked.
  HA HA HA! (Speaker laughs).
"Enjoying yourself? I see you managed to scare off
the only one who could've help you." The voice 
laughs again. "You have 2 choices once you go
through the door. Go to the right, or go to the left.
Both lead to another door. You're currently in the 
center of my domain. Each choice leads to an end. 
Some to towards your escape, and others to your demise!"
You gulp and turn the knob. Carefully you step 
out into the hallway...
