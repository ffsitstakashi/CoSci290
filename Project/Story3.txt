You enter the room and begin to scan if there is any clues 
laying around anywhere. First thing you see is a shelf, a box, 
and two doors missing handles. Right away you begin to think 
if there is any door handles laying around, but you can't seem
to find any on the spot. You begin to panic and think that 
there is a shelf and a box also. You begin searching and 
realize that the box can be broken. 

Do you want to brake the box?
