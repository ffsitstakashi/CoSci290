  You head down the hallway, which leads to a 
door. Looking back you realize the way back has 
been blocked off by a wall. Huh that wasn't there
before right?
  With no other option you open the door...
  It's dark and hard to see. You step inside and 
the door slams shut behind you. The sound of 
running water can be heard. That seems strange. 
Your feet feel cold and it dawns on you the room
is filling with water!
  Out of nowhere a light is turned on and you can
see the door is sealed tight, this water isn't going
anywhere but up...and fast! It's up to your knees
already!
  You quickly scan the room. No windows. You
look around the floor. There seems to be 
something under the water in the corner. You go
to it and pick it up. "What good is a glass box?"
Something in the back of your mind says smash 
the thing... but that'll just get glass everywhere 
and can't help, right?
