  YOU WAKE UP GROGGY AND HAVE A 
pounding headache. The last thing you remember
is having a drink while playing games at Will's. 
You frown and look around. Panic begins to 
spread through you as you realize you don't 
recognize the room you're in and that you're 
alone. How did I get here, you wonder, and where
am I?
  Frantically you scan the room and see there's no 
furniture or windows. There is one door but you 
can't bring yourself to move. You hear what 
sounds like faint moaning and you realize you're
not alone. The pile of clothes on the opposite side
of the room begins to move. It's another person!
