YOU WAKE UP GROGGY AND HAVE A 
pounding headache. The last thing 
you remember is having a drink while 
playing games at Will's. You frown and 
look around. Panic begins to spread 
through you as you realize you don't 
recognize the room you're in and that 
you're alone. How did I get here, you 
wonder, and where am I? Frantically you 
scan the room and see there's no furniture
or windows. But you see there is one door
and a small black box in the corner, 
but you can't bring yourself to move.
