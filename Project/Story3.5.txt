  You head down the hallway which leads to a 
door. Looking back you realize the way back has
been blocked by a wall. Huh, that didn't use to be 
there...
  With no other option you open the door.
  Inside you see light. "Could be a good thing,"
you tell yourself. You step inside and the door
slams shut behind you. Once your eyes adjust to 
the bright light you look around. Huh it's not a 
room like you've seen before. You seem to be in a 
tent of sorts. Strange.
  There are 4 openings. Looking like escaping will
mean choosing wisely. You walk around just 
inside of each and listen for clues to what could be 
behind each door. 
  Behind the first opening you can hear what
sounds like a child's laughter. Behind the 2nd you
can hear absolutely nothing but it feels warmer.can
The 3rd has a eerie feel to it that you can't quite
place. The last has sounds of water similar to the 
ocean, birds chirping, and a soft breeze. Time to 
make a choice...
