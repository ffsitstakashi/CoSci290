Congrats! You have finish the first room. The next ones will 
not be an easy as the first one. Now, please continue on with 
your ESCAPE!

You enter the next room scanning the room to see if there are any 
clues on the floor, but the only things you see are 5 doors and one 
table with wood and a cutting knife. You begin to realize that the 
next way to enter the room is to craft a key and choose one of 
the 5 doors in front.
