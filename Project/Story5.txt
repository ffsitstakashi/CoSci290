Good job! You have crafted a key and moved on to the
next room. The next few rooms will be harder than
before. In this room, there are 2 doors and you will
have to figure out how to get through the door. 

You enter the room, looking around to see if there is 
any eye level clues, but there is nothing in range. 
You see that there is a light at the below of the door.
